# whiteboard-cpp

Common whiteboard problems asked during coding interviews,
solved in C++.

The problems are grouped by category into folders, i.e.
'arrays', 'strings', 'trees', etc.

Each problem is implemented in a separate file, consisting
of the solution itself, as well as a unit test.

Running the project runs all the unit tests.

The project was developed using Eclipse CDT version 3.8.1,
running on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  If you port the project to
another platform, you may have to make minor changes.

Enjoy!
