# whiteboard-cpp

Common whiteboard problems asked during coding interviews,
solved in C++.

The problems are grouped by category into folders, i.e.
'arrays', 'strings', 'trees', etc. Each problem is
implemented in a separate file (or pair of files,
in the case of templates), consisting of the solution
itself, as well as a unit test. Running the project
runs all the unit tests.

The project was developed using the "Mars" version of the
Eclipse IDE for C/C++, running on Mac OS X El Capitan. If
you port the project to another platform, you may have to
make minor changes.

Enjoy!
